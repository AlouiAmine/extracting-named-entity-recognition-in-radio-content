# extracting-named-entity-recognition-in-radio-content

Open media on the web constitutes a rich source for building knowledge
bases, both on technical topics and for general audiences. One way to mine
this available knowledge is to leverage techniques from the Artificial
Intelligence world (e.g. Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing) to
extract important items and construct a knowledge base that can be later
queried and analyzed.
For such an objective, a series of software components need to be developed
and piped in order to analyze raw sources (e.g. radio programs available from
a radio streaming API) and extract semantic representation in a knowledge
graph.
